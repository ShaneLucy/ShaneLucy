The sun was setting, and it was setting right behind the Chisos Mountains. Before I set anything up, I grabbed my canon and started hoofing it towards the mountains, looking for a clear shot of the sunset.\r\n\r\nNo luck. I turned back towards camp.\r\n\r\nThe light from the fading sun rester purple on a rocky hill in front of me. Without hesitating, I started jogging towards it. It was an easy climb, and there was enough light to find my way and not sprain an ankle. The rush was worth it, to sit and soak in the final moments of this beautiful sunset over the Rio Grande.","alt_description":"landscape photography of river leading to mountain","urls":{"raw":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502298771545-937cd94b0f48?ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1","full":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502298771545-937cd94b0f48?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80","regular":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502298771545-937cd94b0f48?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080","small":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502298771545-937cd94b0f48?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=400","thumb":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502298771545-937cd94b0f48?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=200","small_s3":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.unsplash.com/small/photo-1502298771545-937cd94b0f48"},"links":{"self":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/0JJzYdoq62c","html":"https://unsplash.com/photos/0JJzYdoq62c","download":"https://unsplash.com/photos/0JJzYdoq62c/download?ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA","download_location":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/0JJzYdoq62c/download?ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NjQ2NzU2MTA"},"likes":44,"liked_by_user":false,"current_user_collections":[],"sponsorship":null,"topic_submissions":{},"user":{"id":"gda0xxb79bo","updated_at":"2022-10-02T00:10:28Z","username":"kylejglenn","name":"Kyle Glenn","first_name":"Kyle","last_name":"Glenn","twitter_username":"kylejglenn","portfolio_url":"http://kylejglenn.com","bio":"Storyteller via photo, video and music.
