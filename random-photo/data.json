We had come to meet Aurora but as many will know it’s not guaranteed. There had been nothing more than a hint of green in the sky for 6 days. But some of the most beautiful things in life happen when we least expect it. As we stared up at this beautiful mountain the sky started to clear and there she was. There’s nothing like it. Watching green waves ripple above you. curving and twisting as if the sky is dancing for you. It’s moments like these that are worth chasing. Worth working for. Worth waiting for.","alt_description":"man standing beside the body of water with Aurora lights in the sky","urls":{"raw":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509529711801-deac231925ac?ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1","full":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509529711801-deac231925ac?crop=entropy&cs=srgb&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85","regular":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509529711801-deac231925ac?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080","small":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509529711801-deac231925ac?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=400","thumb":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509529711801-deac231925ac?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=200","small_s3":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.unsplash.com/small/photo-1509529711801-deac231925ac"},"links":{"self":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/Hn8N4I4eHA0","html":"https://unsplash.com/photos/Hn8N4I4eHA0","download":"https://unsplash.com/photos/Hn8N4I4eHA0/download?ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA","download_location":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/Hn8N4I4eHA0/download?ixid=MnwyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE2NDU4MzY2OTA"},"categories":[],"likes":1083,"liked_by_user":false,"current_user_collections":[],"sponsorship":null,"topic_submissions":{},"user":{"id":"Ma-IA0tlqDg","updated_at":"2022-02-25T19:44:19-05:00","username":"joshuaearle","name":"Joshua Earle","first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"Earle","twitter_username":"joshua_earle","portfolio_url":null,"bio":"Looking for higher resolution images?
