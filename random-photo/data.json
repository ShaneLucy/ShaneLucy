When we were close to a viewing point we saw that sun was shining through a tiny crack in the clouds and the whole valley was filled with a golden light. We ran like the Fellowship of the Ring, jumping over tree roots and steps of a staircase to the viewing point. The whole shoot took around three minutes: unpack a camera, set up a tripod, choose and change a lens, compose a frame, focus and shoot. I had enough time to only take four frames with different exposures and the sun had gone.","alt_description":"mountains and tree range during golden hour","breadcrumbs":[],"urls":{"raw":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490682143684-14369e18dce8?ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8&ixlib=rb-4.1.0","full":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490682143684-14369e18dce8?crop=entropy&cs=srgb&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=85","regular":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490682143684-14369e18dce8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080","small":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490682143684-14369e18dce8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=400","thumb":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490682143684-14369e18dce8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=200","small_s3":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.unsplash.com/small/photo-1490682143684-14369e18dce8"},"links":{"self":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/mountains-and-tree-range-during-golden-hour-8c6eS43iq1o","html":"https://unsplash.com/photos/mountains-and-tree-range-during-golden-hour-8c6eS43iq1o","download":"https://unsplash.com/photos/8c6eS43iq1o/download?ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8","download_location":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/8c6eS43iq1o/download?ixid=M3wyNzQ3MDB8MHwxfHJhbmRvbXx8fHx8fHx8fDE3NDcyNzIwNDV8"},"likes":4460,"liked_by_user":false,"current_user_collections":[],"sponsorship":null,"topic_submissions":{"nature":{"status":"approved","approved_on":"2020-04-06T14:20:12Z"},"wallpapers":{"status":"approved","approved_on":"2023-12-13T14:34:44Z"}},"asset_type":"photo","user":{"id":"ACVMauHgYZM","updated_at":"2025-01-10T07:01:00Z","username":"sapegin","name":"Artem Sapegin","first_name":"Artem","last_name":"Sapegin","twitter_username":"iamsapegin","portfolio_url":"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sapegin","bio":"Coffee first developer, award-losing photographer, friend of dogs.
