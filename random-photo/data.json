It has been named the Heart nebula, due to its similarities to an anatomically correct heart. In its centre you can see the bright open star cluster named Melotte 15. All of the colour of this gorgeous nebulae is a result of the radiation that is emanating from the only 1.5million year old Melotte 15 cluster. IC1805 is approximately 7.500 light years away from us. This photo required approximately 6 hours of exposure time with a narrowband filter.
